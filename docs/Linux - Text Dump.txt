	When using NAT with VirtualBox, by default the IP adress will always be 10.0.2.15 for every new virtual machine.
	To use SSH to connect from your host to the VrtualBox behind NAT, you mest setup and use Port Forwarding on each VM.
	9.1 In Settings > Network > Adapter 1 tab > Advanced > Click Port Forwarding button to display the Port Forwarding Rules dialog
	9.2 Click green "+" icon to add new rule:
		Change Name from Rule 1 to SSH
		Leave the protocol as TCP
		Leave the Host IP field blanck (empty)
		Set the Host Port to some unused port on yout Host O/S (e.g. 2222ce) And make sure you choose a port that is unique for this virtual machine
		If you have multiple Virtual Box VMs, each will need a different Host Port number.
		Set Guest Port 22
		Click OK
