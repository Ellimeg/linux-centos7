1. Check networking ( as it may not work after the installation)
	1.1 Check network cards
	]# ip a s
	You should see three entries
		1. lo: loopback 127.0.0.1/8
		2. enp0s3: ether inet 10.0.2.4/24 <= NAT Network
		3. enp0s8: ether inet 192.168.99.101/24 <= Host Only network
	]# nmcli conn show
		You should see a list of 2 ethernet connections (both in green)
		enp0s8 may be down (not green & missing an entry in DEVICE column)
	1.2 Activte down connection(s):
	]# nmcli conn up enp0s8
		You should get:
		Connection successfully activated...
		If error: Connection activation failed: IP configuaration could not be reserved (noavailable address, timout, etc)
		Likely due to you updating Virtual Box and not resetting Adaptor 2 (see 1_Install CentOS 7 to Virtual Box>5.4 Network).
		To correct ths:
			1.2.1 Power off the VS
			1.2.2 VS1CentOs7 > Networks > Adaptor 2 > Name: Virtual Host-Only Ethernet Adaptor #n (where n is the highest numbr)>OK
			1.2.3 Power up VS1CentOS7 > login as root >
				]# nmcli conn show 					client connection show
				You should see a list of 2 ethernet connections (both in green)
				]# ip a s 						ip addresses show
				You should see three entries as 1.1

2. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME
	2.1 (As it stands we would have to activate enp0s8 evrytime we logged in)
	To Fix edit the file using sed (we dont have nanao installed as yet!)
	]# sed -i s/ONBOOT=no/ONBOOT=yes/ /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
		<up key back-sapce to just change 3 to 8>
	]# sed -i s/ONBOOT=no/ONBOOT=yes/ /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s8
		To check use grep to search for text in a file. use it with last argument
		you should see ONBOOT=yes
	]# grep ONBOOT !$	
		<up key back-sapce to just change 8 to 3>
		you should see ONBOOT="yes" quote marks are not important (optional) they just mean we did the update.
