Pluralsight: Learning the essentials of CentOS Enterprise Linux Administration - Andrew Mallett.

CentOS Linux is a community-supported distribution derived from sources freely provided to the public by Red Hat for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
	As such, CentOS Linux aims to be functionally compatible with RHEL. The CentOS Project mainly changes packages to remove upstream vendor branding and artwork.
	CentOS Linux is no-cost and free to redistribute.
	Each CentOS version is maintained for up to 10 years (by means of security updates -- the duration of the support interval by Red Hat has varied over time with respect to Sources released).
	A new CentOS version is released approximately every 2 years and each CentOS version is periodically updated (roughly every 6 months) to support newer hardware.
	This results in a secure, low-maintenance, reliable, predictable and reproducible Linux environment.
